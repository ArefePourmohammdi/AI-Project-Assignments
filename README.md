# AI-Project-Assignments

**All assignments and project source code for the AI course at Isfahan University of Technology (Sep 2023 - Jan 2024).**

## Contents

### 1. Water Jug Problem (Assignment 1)
A Python implementation of the classic water jug problem using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)** algorithms. The project finds a sequence of operations to measure exact quantities of water in two unmarked jugs.

### 2. N-Queens Problem & Search Algorithms (Assignment 2)
This assignment involves solving the 9-Queens problem on a 9x9 chessboard using various search algorithms:

- **Hill Climbing Algorithm**:  
  Solve the 9-Queens problem using hill climbing. The solution is repeated 20 times, and the percentage of successful solutions is reported, along with the average number of steps required to find a solution. The result is also displayed as an image.
  
- **Hill Climbing with Side Moves**:  
  The hill climbing algorithm is modified to allow some lateral moves, and again repeated 20 times. The percentage of successful solutions and the average number of steps required are recorded.

- **Simulated Annealing**:  
  The problem is also solved using the simulated annealing algorithm. The percentage of successful solutions and average steps for finding a solution are reported for comparison with hill climbing.

- **OR-AND Search for Wandering Vacuum World**:  
  Implementation of the OR-AND search algorithm for the wandering vacuum world problem.

### 3. N-Queens with Backtracking and Local Search (Assignment 3)
This assignment further explores the 9-Queens problem using additional methods:

- **Backtracking and Constraint Satisfaction**:  
  Solve the 9-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm without any heuristics. Constraint satisfaction methods are used to solve the problem.

- **Local Search Algorithm**:  
  Solve the 9-Queens problem using a local search algorithm.

- **Optional Task (Extra Credit)**:  
  Solve the N-Queens problem (for any N) using at least two different heuristics and compare the results with those obtained in the local search. Report on the impact of the heuristics and the maximum number of queens that can be solved in a reasonable time frame.

### 4. Prolog Project with Hill Climbing
A project implemented using **Prolog** and the **Hill Climbing Algorithm** to solve a given AI problem. The solution explores the effectiveness of Prolog in conjunction with the hill climbing algorithm for AI-based problem-solving.
