# AI-Project-Assignments

**All assignments and project source code for the AI course at Isfahan University of Technology (Sep 2023 - Jan 2024).**

## Contents

- **Assignments:**  
  Solutions to the AI course assignments, covering topics such as search algorithms, machine learning, and logic-based AI.
  
- **Project:**  
  A Python implementation of the classic water jug problem using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)** algorithms. The project finds a sequence of operations to measure exact quantities of water in two unmarked jugs.

## Problem Description

The water jug problem involves two unmarked jugs with capacities of `x` liters and `y` liters. The goal is to measure `a` liters in the first jug and `b` liters in the second jug by performing the following operations:

- Fill either jug completely.
- Empty either jug completely.
- Pour water from one jug to the other until one is full or empty.

### Algorithms Implemented:
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)
- **IDDFS** (Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search)
