# AI-Project-Assignments

**All assignments and project source code for the AI course at Isfahan University of Technology (Sep 2023 - Jan 2024).**

## Contents

- **Assignments:**  
  Solutions to the AI course assignments, covering topics such as search algorithms, machine learning, and logic-based AI.
  
- **Project:**  
  A Python implementation of the classic water jug problem using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)** algorithms. The project finds a sequence of operations to measure exact quantities of water in two unmarked jugs.

## Problem Description

The water jug problem involves two unmarked jugs with capacities of `x` liters and `y` liters. The goal is to measure `a` liters in the first jug and `b` liters in the second jug by performing the following operations:

- Fill either jug completely.
- Empty either jug completely.
- Pour water from one jug to the other until one is full or empty.

### Algorithms Implemented:
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)
- **IDDFS** (Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search)

  ### 2. N-Queens Problem & Search Algorithms (Assignment 2)
This assignment involves solving the 9-Queens problem on a 9x9 chessboard using various search algorithms:

- **Hill Climbing Algorithm**:  
  Solve the 9-Queens problem using hill climbing. The solution is repeated 20 times, and the percentage of successful solutions is reported, along with the average number of steps required to find a solution. The result is also displayed as an image.
  
- **Hill Climbing with Side Moves**:  
  The hill climbing algorithm is modified to allow some lateral moves, and again repeated 20 times. The percentage of successful solutions and the average number of steps required are recorded.

- **Simulated Annealing**:  
  The problem is also solved using the simulated annealing algorithm. The percentage of successful solutions and average steps for finding a solution are reported for comparison with hill climbing.

- **OR-AND Search for Wandering Vacuum World**:  
  Implementation of the OR-AND search algorithm for the wandering vacuum world problem.
